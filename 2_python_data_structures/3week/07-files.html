<p>Exercise 1: Write a program to read through a file and print the contents of the file (line by line) all in upper case. Executing the program will look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>python shout.py
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt

<p>You can download the file from</p>
<p><a href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt">www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt</a></p>
<p>Exercise 2: Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through the file and look for lines of the form:</p>
<p><code>X-DSPAM-Confidence:</code><strong><code>0.8475</code></strong></p>
<p>When you encounter a line that starts with &quot;X-DSPAM-Confidence:&quot; pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line. Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam confidence values from these lines. When you reach the end of the file, print out the average spam confidence.</p>
<pre><code>Enter the file name: mbox.txt
Average spam confidence: 0.894128046745

Enter the file name: mbox-short.txt
Average spam confidence: 0.750718518519</code></pre>
<p>Test your file on the <code>mbox.txt</code> and <code>mbox-short.txt</code> files.</p>
<p>Exercise 3: Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun, they add a harmless <em>Easter Egg</em> to their program Modify the program that prompts the user for the file name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name &quot;na na boo boo&quot;. The program should behave normally for all other files which exist and don't exist. Here is a sample execution of the program:</p>
<pre><code>python egg.py
Enter the file name: mbox.txt
There were 1797 subject lines in mbox.txt

python egg.py
Enter the file name: missing.tyxt
File cannot be opened: missing.tyxt

python egg.py
Enter the file name: na na boo boo
NA NA BOO BOO TO YOU - You have been punk'd!</code></pre>
<p>We are not encouraging you to put Easter Eggs in your programs; this is just an exercise.</p>
